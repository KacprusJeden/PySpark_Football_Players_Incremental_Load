# PySpark_Football_Players_Incremental_Load   

This is implementation of incremental load using PySpark.   
Example was inspired by this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcJosevS8o4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcJosevS8o4)    

   
In this projet you have:
- algorithm with SCD2 and incremental loading
- requirements.txt with needed libraries to import
- unit tests in pytest
